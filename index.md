## About me: 
I received my B.Tech. and Ph.D. degrees in [<ins>Electrical Engineering</ins>](http://www.iitk.ac.in/ee/) from the [<ins>Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur</ins>](http://www.iitk.ac.in/), India. My Ph.D. thesis was entitled "[<ins>Analysis of Pitched Polyphonic Music for Source Transcription</ins>](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0By8wZfM49Y2ScC1vc2lVX0I1c1U/view)", where I worked on analyzing music audio to identify and transcribe different instruments/voices playing simultaneously. During postdoc at Oxford University (UK), I developed [<ins>speech recognition</ins>](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tgr3Y_U9BsQ) systems using linguistic principles, with applications in automatic language teacher and speech recognition for low-resource languages. At Amazon in Boston (USA), I worked on audio classification for developing Alexa [<ins>home security</ins>](https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/20/17883428/amazon-alexa-guard-alarm-ring-smart-home-security-price) system, with research focusing on classification with imbalanced data.
