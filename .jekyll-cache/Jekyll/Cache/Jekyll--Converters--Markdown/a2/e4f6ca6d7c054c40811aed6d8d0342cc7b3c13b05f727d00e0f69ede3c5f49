I"ü<h2 id="about-me">About me:</h2>
<p>I received my B.Tech. and Ph.D. degrees in <a href="http://www.iitk.ac.in/ee/"><ins>Electrical Engineering</ins></a> from the <a href="http://www.iitk.ac.in/"><ins>Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur</ins></a>, India. My Ph.D. thesis was entitled ‚Äú<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0By8wZfM49Y2ScC1vc2lVX0I1c1U/view"><ins>Analysis of Pitched Polyphonic Music for Source Transcription</ins></a>‚Äù, where I worked on analyzing music audio to identify and transcribe different instruments/voices playing simultaneously. During postdoc at Oxford University (UK), I developed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tgr3Y_U9BsQ"><ins>speech recognition</ins></a> systems using linguistic principles, with applications in automatic language teacher and speech recognition for low-resource languages. At Amazon in Boston (USA), I worked on audio classification for developing Alexa <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/20/17883428/amazon-alexa-guard-alarm-ring-smart-home-security-price"><ins>home security</ins></a> system, with research focusing on classification with imbalanced data.</p>
